# FS25_FleetView

A quality-of-life mod for Farming Simulator 25 that overhauls the default vehicle switching system. 

Stop blindly pressing the `Tab` key to cycle through your entire farm! **FS25_FleetView** replaces the vanilla tab-to-switch behavior with an interactive UI, giving you a complete overview of your fleet and letting you jump into the exact tractor you need in one click.
